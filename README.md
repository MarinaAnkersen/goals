# Expected points REST API project
## Description
This project is implemented using Flask and is a REST API for expected and
actual points in Premier League current season. The application is
containerised using Docker. There is no ETL yet and project is using static
data files.
## Installation
Start by ensuring that you have Docker:
```
docker -v
```
and Docker Compose:
```
docker-compose -v
```
Build the image:
```
docker-compose build
```
Once the build is done, fire up the container:
```
docker-compose up -d
```
Run the following commands to create database and seed it with initial data:
```
docker-compose exec goals python3 manage.py recreate_db
docker-compose exec goals python manage.py seed_db
```
Try one of the endpoints out locally:
http://localhost:5001/users
## Running the tests
Run the tests using:
```
docker-compose exec goals python -m pytest "project/tests"
```
disable warnings:
```
docker-compose exec goals python -m pytest "project/tests" -p no:warnings
```
run with coverage report generation:
```
docker-compose exec goals python3 -m pytest "project/tests" -p no:warnings --cov="project" --cov-report html
```
## Flask Admin
